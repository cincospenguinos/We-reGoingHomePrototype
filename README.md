# Laser Game

I'll come up with a better name for it soon. This is a prototype of a game I want to make.

## Ideas

- [ ] Rotate pieces of the puzzle on mouse scroll over
- [ ] Allow for eight directions instead of the cardinal four
- [ ] Have lasers be determined by their colors, and do not allow lasers to cross each other
- [ ] Allow surfaces to reflect from certain sides of themselves, or have it change depending on the direction the light comes from
- [ ] Allow puzzles to have multiple targets
