# Laser Game

I'll come up with a better name for it soon. This is a prototype of a game I want to make.

## Ideas

- [ ] Rotate pieces of the puzzle on mouse scroll over
- [ ] Allow for eight directions instead of the cardinal four
- [ ] Have lasers be determined by their colors, and do not allow lasers to cross each other
- [ ] Allow surfaces to reflect from certain sides of themselves, or have it change depending on the direction the light comes from
- [ ] Allow puzzles to have multiple targets
- [ ] Mousing over something movable in the puzzle causes an outline to appear
- [ ] Moving lasers--this gives us a way to make the transversive sections more engaging.
- [ ] There should be some sort of cue to the player when they solve the puzzle

## Notes

* To add physics to an existing sprite, do `this.physics.add.existing(spriteHere)`
