# README

This directory is for the creation of our design document. The purpose of the design document is to communicate ideas between our present and future selves. It will be our game bible, detailing all the little pieces of how things are to fit together and work. Refer to this massive document for details about how the game should be put together.

Note that it is a living document, meaning that it is subject to change at any time, according to the observations and desires of its creators (Stefano and I.)

## How this is organized

Right now, there are four files: [`aesthetics.md`](aesthetics.md), [`mechanics.md`](mechanics.md), [`story.md`](story.md), and [`technology.md`](technology.md). Each file explains the various pieces for each component. So if I need to know how the code will be organized, details about that will be in `technology.md`. If I need to know how something will look, I would check `aesthetics.md`.

## But that's not a design document! [This is!](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131791/the_anatomy_of_a_design_document_.php?page=2)

Agreed. But I need to start somewhere, and this is where I'm going to start.
