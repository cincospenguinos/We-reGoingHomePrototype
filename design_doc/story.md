## Endings

There are a multitude of endings for the game, all of which are entirely dependent upon how you raised your kids. There are generally two types of endings:

* Self-sacrifice ending
	* Neither son was skilled enough to live on their own, so you send them both home
	* What cutscene is shown at the end depends on how well you connected with your kids in the game
* Sending your son into the world
	* If one son has a high enough set of life skills (see [mechanics.md](mechanics.md),) then you will have the option to tell that son to stay put
	* The ending that is shown is dependent on the love stat (representing your relationship) and which son is told to stay (this is a reflection of their personalities)
	* If both sons stay, then a few endings are available according to your love stat for each of them, and theirs for each other
