## Dungeons

There are ten dungeons, named after each one of the [Sephirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot) on the [Tree of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(Kabbalah) in the [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah). The player plays through the bottom ones up to the top ones, so they will be labled accordingly:

### Malkhuth ("Kingship")

The opening dungeon is about how our main character is in control over the pieces of nature (hence "kingship" is its title.) The player will be approaching an empty wasteland of death and decay, and will be rebuilding it into a garden to grow food for his sons (see [mechanics](mechanics.md), section on gardening.)

The outer entrance leading up to the tree is covered in snow when the King comes back to it. Dense (and now dead) foliage has spread all around it, and the once glorious and ornate garden is torn down into ruins. Crumbling stone walls surround them, crushed both by the massive tree in the distance, and by the vines and plant life that has spread unencumbered.

There is a crumbling fountain, made of concrete, ornate and beautiful. On top of the fountain is a sculpture of the Queen, her arms down and outstretched, offering her blessings to all who come visit. This fountain was made by the King himself in honor of his wife.

The path is made of bricks, fired from within the tree. The path is surrounded by open fields of grass and dirt, covered under a thick layer of snow (there are multiple seasons in the game, and so we will have multiple pallettes--see [mechanics.md](mechanics.md) for details.) The various "rooms" of the dungeon have paths that lead to the various "doors" (open spaces between the walls or roots of the tree.)
