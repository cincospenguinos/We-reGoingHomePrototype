# PROTO-0.5.md

**Question:** Is making decisions with raising your kids given the idea I have in my mind about fulfilling needs actually fun?

## Decisions

* Since we are testing whether or not caring for your kids is fun, this prototype is solely in "adventure game" format
	* This is included in the `childproto` directory, and is contained within the `childproto.rb` file.

## Discoveries

* Giving just a little blurb on the status of your kid is kind of difficult to interpret, and bogs down the gameplay to be kind of shitty. In the real game, we will want to find ways to communicate the stat information to the player as best as we can without resorting to just having a menu where that status is shown.
