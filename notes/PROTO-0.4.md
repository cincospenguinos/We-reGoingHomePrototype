**Question:** How does modifying the puzzle so that color determines movement change the dungeon design?

## Decisions

## Discoveries

## To Improve

* Communicating what to do to the player is a big problem
	* Tasha appreciated highlighting something white to indicate that it could move (the panel was immediately recognizable in its interactability for that reason)
	* Tasha was incredibly frustrated that moving the laser wasn't immediately explained to her
* The puzzle scene is too small
	* Having to move tiny elements in a tiny space isn't fun to Tasha
	* Given how intense we want this game to be, that's something we should really adjust. Perhaps setting the scale to 4 would improve things in that department.
* The puzzle scene needs to be moved to the center of the screen
	* There is a way for Phaser to do this--it just needs to be done

## What should we try to answer next?

* What other elements/barriers should we incorporate to make more interesting dungeons?
	* Keys for doors
	* Hitting switches/panels/buttons in different rooms
	* A big key for a main door
