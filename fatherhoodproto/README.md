# Fatherhood Prototype

This directory's purpose is to explore how much fun the fatherhood elements of the game are. Basically it's a prototype for the other half of the game. This prototype doesn't need to be finished anytime soon--it's mostly what I'm doing for fun while I have nothing else to work on.

## How do I run this?

```bash
$ cd ~/this-repo-dir/fatherhoodproto
~/this-repo-dir/fatherhoodproto$ ./fatherhoodproto.rb
```

## How do I interact with it?

Just use commands, man. It's like a text adventure game, but shittier. But the purpose is to explore how the child-caring section should work, not anything else.

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out relationship between different needs
	* Love stat should be a need--like a care stat
	* Love stat decreases dramatically when more basic needs are neglected
	* Love stat increases slightly for lower-level needs, but increases more for higher-level needs, but doesn't increase at all when higher-level care is provided (hugs, encouragement, instruction, etc.) and physical needs are not met.
- [ ] Add skills training for children
- [ ]
